Although the songs concerned themselves with bereavement, the marital breakup of frontman Leo Wyndham’s parents and similarly weighty topics, at times there was a detachment to his delivery that seemed at odds with the subject matter. Loss is once again a recurrent theme on the London-based group’s’s follow-up – not least on the opening title track (“She’s watching from heaven/ She’s always beside you”) and epic closer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cS_i-zDdxg\" title=\"\">Heaven Up There</a> – but pleasingly, Wyndham sings with far greater confidence and conviction this time.</p> <p>With the band now a three-piece, following the departure of bassist Will Dorey, there’s an organic warmth to the arrangements on <em>Life After</em>, Rupert Turner’s guitar and Matt Hodges’ drums foregrounding Wyndham without ever stealing the spotlight, even on the more strident <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE2oX0ra1M8\" title=\"\">Running Wild</a> (don’t be fooled by the title: it doesn’t represent a departure into freewheeling debauched rock-piggery). If there is a criticism it’s that, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On-ZxMmgwE8\" title=\"\">Martyr</a> and Running Wild aside, there’s too little that really grabs the attention.

Although the songs concerned themselves with bereavement, the marital breakup of frontman Leo Wyndham’s parents and similarly weighty topics, at times there was a detachment to his delivery that seemed at odds with the subject matter. Loss is once again a recurrent theme on the London-based group’s’s follow-up – not least on the opening title track (“She’s watching from heaven/ She’s always beside you”) and epic closer Heaven Up There – but pleasingly, Wyndham sings with far greater confidence and conviction this time. With the band now a three-piece, following the departure of bassist Will Dorey, there’s an organic warmth to the arrangements on Life After, Rupert Turner’s guitar and Matt Hodges’ drums foregrounding Wyndham without ever stealing the spotlight, even on the more strident Running Wild (don’t be fooled by the title: it doesn’t represent a departure into freewheeling debauched rock-piggery). If there is a criticism it’s that, Martyr and Running Wild aside, there’s too little that really grabs the attention. Still, not many bands do better emotionally literate, melancholic indie at the moment.",

There was plenty of evidence that his career was in the process of taking off – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/sep/08/ed-sheeran-plus-review\">his album +</a> had just spent its fifth week at No 1, he had sold out two nights at the 5,000-capacity venue and was already famous enough that he couldn’t smoke a cigarette out of the dressing room window without bringing the street below to a standstill. But there was nothing to suggest the level of success he was about to encounter. </p> <p>That is, unless you were Sheeran, who already exuded an intriguing mixture of sweet-natured, self-deprecating charm and steely, vaulting ambition. No, he wasn’t surprised + had been so successful, even if everyone else seemed to be: “Because the music I write is like love songs with big hooks, I kind of knew it would end up where it’s ended up if it got the right radio play.” During the photoshoot, he claimed that he already had a career plan in place: two more albums, each named after a mathematical symbol, then an album of duets with huge names. “Then I’ll calm it down a bit.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fe51eebf060b8bdd99e98e4eac271ef79260177c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe51eebf060b8bdd99e98e4eac271ef79260177c/0_0_1500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The artwork for Ed Sheeran’s No 6 Collaborations Project.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The artwork for Ed Sheeran’s No 6 Collaborations Project.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This writer – who had pegged Sheeran as the new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/newton-faulkner\">Newton Faulkner</a>, rather than the next Epoch-Defining Ruler of Pop – listened to said career plan in a spirit of nonplussed indulgence: <em>nothing wrong with dreaming big, mate</em>. But here we are, seven years, two more albums named after mathematical symbols and 162m sales later, staring down the barrel of Ed Sheeran’s promised album of duets. </p> <p>The supporting cast has changed considerably from the names he suggested back in 2012: the selection of classic rockers beloved of his dad appears to have been jettisoned – although in fairness, Sheeran has already collaborated with Elton John, Eric Clapton and the Rolling Stones – leaving <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/eminem\">Eminem</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/50cent\">50 Cent</a>, of all people, in the grizzled old Methuselah roles.</p> <p>Everything else, however, appears to have turned out pretty much as he said it would. It’s a tribute to his ongoing dominion over the charts – not just as an artist but as a songwriter, whose donated cast-offs have shown a marked tendency to reach No 1 in 18 countries – that the credits look like a who’s who of the current pop landscape: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/cardi-b\">Cardi B</a>, Camila Cabello, Khalid, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/justin-bieber\">Justin Bieber</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/bruno-mars\">Bruno Mars</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/travis-scott\">Travis Scott</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/skrillex\">Skrillex</a>, Meek Mill and A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie. Sheeran’s adoption by the UK hip-hop scene – just as the UK hip-hop scene exploded into the mainstream – isn’t the reason for his success, but it didn’t exactly hinder it either: here, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/stormzy\">Stormzy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/dave\">Dave</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/j-hus\">J Hus</a> line up to take part.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the end result sounds not unlike a Top 20 rundown or Spotify’s Hot Hits UK playlist. That should give you an idea of whether you’ll like it – in the unlikely event that there’s anyone out there who hasn’t already made their mind up about Ed Sheeran – but it also tells you how commercial it all is. It skips from acoustic balladry (Best Part of Me, the latest Sheeran song precision-tooled to be the first-dance music at weddings for all eternity) to the straightforward hip-hop of Travis Scott vehicle Antisocial, to an unexpected burst of Led Zep-by-way-of-Queens-of-the-Stone-Age riffage on Blow, to Take Me Back to London, a pop-grime track with lyrics that detail the friendship between Sheeran and Stormzy while offering listeners a study in contrasts between their personas. “Chat shit, get banged … all those stupid pricks on the ‘gram,” snaps Stormzy; “I’m back in the biz with my guys, give me a packet of crisps and a pint,” offers Sheeran.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfkxLRuSteI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CfkxLRuSteI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Ed Sheeran and Travis Scott: Antisocial – video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The sound skews noticeably towards the R&amp;B-influenced end of his oeuvre represented by Sing and Shape of You: if there isn’t a song here quite as undeniable as either of those, then both the Khalid feature Beautiful People, which sets an indelible melody line and chorus amid soft-focus synths, and Put It All on Me, which features Ella Mai and an insistent guitar hook draped languidly over a breakbeat, runs them close. Indeed, it occasionally cleaves a little too closely for its own good: South of the Border sounds perilously similar to Shape of You. The latter also sees the appearance of what you might call the shameless Sheeran of Galway Girl, a man abundantly aware that the general public’s notion of cool seldom chimes with that of record labels or indeed rock critics. Charged with writing a song for the Cuban-American Camilla Cabello, he manages to last barely a minute before breaking out the Latin language of love: “<em>Te amo, mam</em><em>á</em>.”</p> <p>It’s not the only moment that doesn’t work. You can see the logic behind the Eminem and 50 Cent collaboration Remember the Name – the jaunty musical backing is clearly designed in the image of The Real Slim Shady – but there’s something jarring about Eminem rapping about sticking nails in his eyeballs next to Sheeran repping Ipswich.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s93NCuXt7x4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/s93NCuXt7x4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Ed Sheeran, Chris Stapleton and Bruno Mars: Blow – video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>But elsewhere, Sheeran succeeds in pulling off his patent trick of simultaneously stunning you with the pitiless commercial efficiency of his writing while retaining a certain ordinary-bloke humanity. For all the bragging about his achievements when the genre he’s dabbling in warrants it – put him in the studio with a rapper and it won’t be too long before he starts filling you in on the eye-popping financial take-home of his last world tour ($340m, in case you’re wondering) – there’s a tang of affecting authenticity about the parade of neuroses on display elsewhere in the lyrics. This ranges from social anxiety to fretting about the onset of male-pattern baldness: a reminder that, while Sheeran undoubtedly pioneered the valuable pop commodity of #relatability, he did it by default rather than design.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/10/ed-sheeran-is-uks-most-played-artist-of-2018-despite-not-releasing-any-music\">Ed Sheeran is UK's most-played artist of 2018 despite not releasing any music</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet a certain confidence oozes from No 6 Collaborations. And why wouldn’t it? It doesn’t suggest any slackening of his grasp on what people want to hear: the only thing likely to prevent it becoming a vast success is some kind of mass-extinction event. And the only question it raises is whether he’s now ready to put the next stage of his strategy into action and calm it down a bit. Maybe: there’s a distinct sense of the victory lap about the album. Or maybe not. “It ain’t my time to call it a day,” he sings at one juncture. If he doesn’t, it’ll count as the one time things haven’t gone exactly to plan.</p>",

But here we are, seven years, two more albums named after mathematical symbols and 162m sales later, staring down the barrel of Ed Sheeran’s promised album of duets. The supporting cast has changed considerably from the names he suggested back in 2012: the selection of classic rockers beloved of his dad appears to have been jettisoned – although in fairness, Sheeran has already collaborated with Elton John, Eric Clapton and the Rolling Stones – leaving Eminem and 50 Cent, of all people, in the grizzled old Methuselah roles. Everything else, however, appears to have turned out pretty much as he said it would. It’s a tribute to his ongoing dominion over the charts – not just as an artist but as a songwriter, whose donated cast-offs have shown a marked tendency to reach No 1 in 18 countries – that the credits look like a who’s who of the current pop landscape: Cardi B, Camila Cabello, Khalid, Justin Bieber, Bruno Mars, Travis Scott, Skrillex, Meek Mill and A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie. Sheeran’s adoption by the UK hip-hop scene – just as the UK hip-hop scene exploded into the mainstream – isn’t the reason for his success, but it didn’t exactly hinder it either: here, Stormzy, Dave and J Hus line up to take part. Unsurprisingly, the end result sounds not unlike a Top 20 rundown or Spotify’s Hot Hits UK playlist. That should give you an idea of whether you’ll like it – in the unlikely event that there’s anyone out there who hasn’t already made their mind up about Ed Sheeran – but it also tells you how commercial it all is. It skips from acoustic balladry (Best Part of Me, the latest Sheeran song precision-tooled to be the first-dance music at weddings for all eternity) to the straightforward hip-hop of Travis Scott vehicle Antisocial, to an unexpected burst of Led Zep-by-way-of-Queens-of-the-Stone-Age riffage on Blow, to Take Me Back to London, a pop-grime track with lyrics that detail the friendship between Sheeran and Stormzy while offering listeners a study in contrasts between their personas. “Chat shit, get banged … all those stupid pricks on the ‘gram,” snaps Stormzy; “I’m back in the biz with my guys, give me a packet of crisps and a pint,” offers Sheeran. The sound skews noticeably towards the R&amp;B-influenced end of his oeuvre represented by Sing and Shape of You: if there isn’t a song here quite as undeniable as either of those, then both the Khalid feature Beautiful People, which sets an indelible melody line and chorus amid soft-focus synths, and Put It All on Me, which features Ella Mai and an insistent guitar hook draped languidly over a breakbeat, runs them close. Indeed, it occasionally cleaves a little too closely for its own good: South of the Border sounds perilously similar to Shape of You. The latter also sees the appearance of what you might call the shameless Sheeran of Galway Girl, a man abundantly aware that the general public’s notion of cool seldom chimes with that of record labels or indeed rock critics. Charged with writing a song for the Cuban-American Camilla Cabello, he manages to last barely a minute before breaking out the Latin language of love: “Te amo, mamá.” It’s not the only moment that doesn’t work. You can see the logic behind the Eminem and 50 Cent collaboration Remember the Name – the jaunty musical backing is clearly designed in the image of The Real Slim Shady – but there’s something jarring about Eminem rapping about sticking nails in his eyeballs next to Sheeran repping Ipswich. But elsewhere, Sheeran succeeds in pulling off his patent trick of simultaneously stunning you with the pitiless commercial efficiency of his writing while retaining a certain ordinary-bloke humanity. For all the bragging about his achievements when the genre he’s dabbling in warrants it – put him in the studio with a rapper and it won’t be too long before he starts filling you in on the eye-popping financial take-home of his last world tour ($340m, in case you’re wondering) – there’s a tang of affecting authenticity about the parade of neuroses on display elsewhere in the lyrics. This ranges from social anxiety to fretting about the onset of male-pattern baldness: a reminder that, while Sheeran undoubtedly pioneered the valuable pop commodity of #relatability, he did it by default rather than design. Yet a certain confidence oozes from No 6 Collaborations. And why wouldn’t it? It doesn’t suggest any slackening of his grasp on what people want to hear: the only thing likely to prevent it becoming a vast success is some kind of mass-extinction event. And the only question it raises is whether he’s now ready to put the next stage of his strategy into action and calm it down a bit. Maybe: there’s a distinct sense of the victory lap about the album. Or maybe not. “It ain’t my time to call it a day,” he sings at one juncture. If he doesn’t, it’ll count as the one time things haven’t gone exactly to plan.",

                    "body": "<p>Invariably, queer pop stars worship David Bowie, and Dorian Electra is no different. “My dad got me into Bowie from a really young age,” they say. “I looked up to androgynous rock stars.” What’s less common is worshipping Bono. “He was one of my heroes as a kid. I know, funny: everyone hates him. But I really loved him, and used to dress up as him. That was one of my first experiences in what I guess you could call drag, but I would call dressing up. I performed the song Vertigo, just for my family – I drew on a little beard with my stepmom’s eyeliner.”</p> <p>And so, with a home performance of a U2 song, Electra set off on the way to becoming the most lively and witty new pop star of 2019. Assigned female at birth but now defining as gender-fluid, they are about to release their debut album: a brilliant collection of ultra-synthetic, cartoonishly masculine pop, delivered wearing a perfect pencil moustache.</p> <p>Dorian and Electra are the first two names on their birth certificate, along with two more that they ask me not to divulge (along with their age). “I’ll tell all about everything else!” And boy, do they – their diagnosed attention deficit disorder triggers more than 10,000 words down the phone during our conversation, sentences constantly interrupted with a newer, even more interesting thought.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDDukLyXY-M\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MDDukLyXY-M?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Electra grew up in Houston to an artist mother and a father who performed covers in a rock band after work: “He’s not the best singer, but he’s got the moves.” The couple split when Electra was five; after that, their mother dated women. “When I was eight, I was like: ‘So this friend of yours is always staying over, are you a lesbian?’ She was like: ‘Yeah, honey, I am.’ And I was like: ‘That’s OK.’ I knew those other options were open to me.”</p> <p>As a kid, they felt “really androgynous: I wasn’t into the things girls were into, but I hated sports, or playing with GI Joe. I always identified with the word kid more than girl or boy.” In high school, they would have crushes on boys, “but I didn’t feel like a girl liking a guy. Love stories in movies were very alienating to me.” </p> <p>One of their teachers, an out, “Oscar Wilde type figure” who also worked as the coach of the debating team, beguiled Dorian and the group of “nerdy boys” they fell in with. “We were … I’m hesitant to say the word brainwashed, because that takes away my agency, and he did come from a good place. But basically I was brainwashed to think the state was evil, that you can’t use government to do anything good, because it is an institution of force.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"23bcbb5a3d986c4b02eeec56097cd03c9aac84dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23bcbb5a3d986c4b02eeec56097cd03c9aac84dd/0_284_2396_2395/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘I wonder how much of me loving dressing up like a knight or a cowboy maybe a product of my own internalised misogyny’ … Electra.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I wonder how much of me loving dressing up like a knight or a cowboy maybe a product of my own internalised misogyny’ … Electra.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lance Williams/PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The teacher was a libertarian, and his politics shaped Electra’s whole youth: one of their earliest viral hits was a song called <a href=\"https://mises.org/files/im-love-friedrich-hayek-dorian-electra-official-music-video\" title=\"\">I’m In Love With Friedrich Hayek</a>, a ballad to the economist who influenced Reagan and Thatcher’s free-market ideology. “I watch a lot of documentaries about people coming out of cults, because I really relate to that,” Electra says. “Where it’s a charismatic leader, of young impressionable people, who are all very passionate and want to change the world. And then being led by this charisma into these ideas that now I’m really embarrassed by.”</p> <p>It took going to university in Chicago in 2010 to wake Electra up. “As a product of human thought, libertarianism is a very interesting thing to study, but it is really poisonous. First, I thought I could change libertarians’ minds and make them more aware of stuff like feminism, and then I was like: no, this isn’t going to work.” One positive takeaway, though, was realising the power of culture to influence thought, and thought to influence culture – and so they began using music to try and expand minds.</p> <p>“I wrote songs about Descartes,” they say. “And I did this little collection of songs all about thought experiments. One was a hair metal song called Brain in a Vat.” Electra also created a web series, playing car salesman Don Bogman – a grotesque male character they honed while in real life being quite the opposite: a stripper working in a club near Chicago’s airport. Performing their feminine side to the extreme, they served up “booby shots” dressed in “the most insane push-up bra ever, this tiny fishnet dress and two thongs. You would put this test tube of tequila and orange juice between your boobs, and the person would have to fish it out with their mouth, and that cost $5. Selling shots was just a vehicle to get talking to people. I would also do topless private lap dances. That’s how you really made money. Sometimes I would tell people about Don Bogman, and they would ask me to do the voice. I’m essentially in drag as a woman – that’s how I’m feeling – but I’m telling them I’m this nasty used-car salesman. Some people were not very interested. But the people who were interested, they’d tip me nicely.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0d3b2317eb9c125b6d1dd2d93ab4d8721991dcc5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d3b2317eb9c125b6d1dd2d93ab4d8721991dcc5/0_0_5422_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dorian Electra in concert at Elsewhere, New York, May 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"605\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dorian Electra in concert at Elsewhere, New York, May 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adela Loconte/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It all fed into their next job at women’s lifestyle website <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us\" title=\"\">Refinery29</a>, when bosses came across some of Electra’s music and suggested they make songs about sex education. This was their real breakthrough: a series of hilarious high-production pop videos that told the history of feminism, drag, vibrators, the clitoris and high-heeled shoes respectively. In the last song, the rejection of high heels following the French revolution is explained thus: “Monarchy is so last season / The feet of the elite smell like treason.” In another, a dismayed Electra sings of a vaping Dr Freud: “He couldn’t see / all stimulation happens clitorally.” It’s like the comedy trio The Lonely Island, if they read up on intersectionality.</p> <p>“I wrote them like an essay: the thesis becomes the chorus,” they explain. “I love geometry and formal logic, I’m really analytical. So it’s easier for me to make a song like that than it is for me to be like: let’s dig deep into myself, and pull out some subconscious association and poetry. I’m not romantic at all.”</p> <p>Writing the songs also set Electra on a path to defining their gender identity. After wearing their trademark moustache in a photoshoot for the first time, “I had never felt more like myself than I did in that picture. It communicates man, masculine, within these two little symbols. Putting it on, all of a sudden it makes me feel grounded.”</p> <p>They don’t define as a drag king though – “I’m not a woman dressing as a man, it’s so much more complex than that” – nor do they feel like a man all the time. “When I came across ‘gender fluid’, I was like: that term actually really resonates with me,” they say. “But the core of my being is not gendered at all – even ‘gender fluid’ is a form of identity that can put somebody in a box.” They say culture is currently at a moment of admitting: “Hey, there are many boxes. And then eventually, if humanity survives, it’ll be like: actually, we don’t need these boxes any more. I do think that the labels are incredibly empowering though, and for people to fight just to be in the other box as male and female, as a trans person, is still enormous.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9619e8936461fa12629ce9d8783442f82ecd876\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9619e8936461fa12629ce9d8783442f82ecd876/0_0_3072_3348/918.jpg\" alt=\"‘Flamboyant is a word that’s been used in a very derogatory way’: Dorian Electra.\" width=\"918\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Flamboyant is a word that’s been used in a very derogatory way’: Dorian Electra.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Weston Allen/PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The songs on their album – made collaboratively with a team of songwriters and producers who have ridiculously hip names such as <a href=\"http://www.michaelzarowny.com/about\" title=\"\">Mood Killer</a> and <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/absrdst\" title=\"\">Absrdst</a> – poke holes in society’s boxes and make faces through them. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDDukLyXY-M\" title=\"\">Career Boy</a> casts Electra as an office drone finding an erotic allure in overwork; the video has them shackled bondage-style to filing cabinets and stapling themselves, before burning out, dying and being revived by a coffee IV. It lampoons the obsessional “let’s get this bread” mindset in the US, but also sympathises with it. Electra says the song “tries to take a little piece of Wall Street and make it queer”, and queer people tell them that the song helps motivate them through their 9 to 5 – indeed, wearing the business clothes of the establishment can be a kind of enforced drag. “It’s how you survive in any capitalist or governmental structure,” Electra says. “Trying to be aware of it and how it’s bad, but in order to cope with living, being able to embrace some of the irony of it.”</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk4BZ3uOSHI\" title=\"\">Daddy Like</a>, Electra appears as a sugar daddy – a rich person who funds someone’s lifestyle in exchange for intimacy. They say there are too many songs “that play into that dynamic without challenging it”, but doesn’t want to tear the daddies down, either. “It can be sweet. I have a lot of friends who do sex work and have sugar daddies, to fund their prolific, amazing art careers, and would not be able to do that if they didn’t have that support. So it was also about getting rid of some of the shame and stigma around that.”</p> <p>The staggeringly good, utterly OTT <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDb1oTfcmCI\" title=\"\">Flamboyant</a>, meanwhile, is a celebration of foppishness. “Flamboyant is a word that’s been used in a very derogatory way, like ‘flagrant’: an obvious gay, effeminate person,” they say. So Electra took the term back to its origins in French gothic architecture, to describe flames in stained glass. “Anything colourful that’s begging to be looked at and is out there and bright – those meanings all came together. My work is all about using pop, which I love, to show something a little bit different. Not falling into feminine pop tropes, but still being able to take a bit of the Britney Spears vibe in what I do, and the polish of the sound and the visuals. And being like: hey, I’m just me.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDb1oTfcmCI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BDb1oTfcmCI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>For Electra, flamboyance is a symptom of camp, an “inherently queer” state. “Camp sees outside of the status quo, and also has a sense of humour, to cope with it, that’s knowing but also sincere.” No wonder they are about to go on tour with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/charli-xcx\" title=\"\">Charli XCX</a>, another pop star who walks that line. Electra recently appeared in a music video by one of the masters of modern camp, Paris Hilton, and they celebrate Hilton’s “over-the-top self-awareness, in a camp way: her being a parody of herself, but a really savvy businessperson in her branding. The coolest thing about her is that she still has the finger on the pulse of where she stands culturally, whereas you see a lot of people like that lose touch, and think they are still perceived as the person they were back then.”</p> <p>Like a vaping Freud, it is tempting to do some armchair psychology: when Electra dresses up as a matador, a gladiator and a boxer for the song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3K6_89Ee4U\" title=\"\">Man to Man</a>, is it to hide their vulnerability? “I wonder how much of me loving these masculine things – dressing up like a knight or a cowboy – how much of these things are not good, and maybe a product of my own internalised misogyny,” they ponder. “But I do feel very empowered and strong. I’m always so grateful for the support system I’ve had emotionally, and being able to be who I am. Maybe my work offers that to other people – maybe it resonates because they are finding strength in reclaiming the things they were bullied by, or were told they couldn’t be a part of. I can be a gladiator in a cultural sense.” In that sense at least, Dorian Electra is slaying.</p> <p><em>The album Flamboyant is out 17 July</em></p>",
